    description: "Hi, I'm a fourth year engineering student at Cy-Tech studying computer science and mathematics applied to finance I have experience developping software, implementing algorithms and simulations. I strive to create software that not only functions efficiently under the hood, but also provides intuitive user experiences. I like learning new ways to create clean, efficient, and scalable code. I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn. At the end of the day, my primary goal is to create things that makes our life easier with people that bring out the best in me. When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably hanging out with friends or family, traveling, or driving cars which I really appretiate. This page was mainly built to highlight the projects that I've done and it's always under changes",
