# Personal website with source code ðŸš€

## What I used
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for writting the code
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for easy push-to-deploy hosting
- [React](https://fr.reactjs.org/) for building a clean static website

>The gh-pages branch has the built project
